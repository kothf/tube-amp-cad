## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.0] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- Tube currents and dissipation now match the datasheets. Every amplifier
  tube was refitted to its published operating points; previously many were
  far off, e.g. 845 15× too high, 6S19P 8×, 6V6GT/6L6GC 3×, 300B 2.4×, while
  12AX7, 12AT7, 6N2P and ECC88 ran at about half current and the GM-70 had
  µ 11.5 instead of 6.
- Triode-connected pentodes are fitted to the same tube's pentode model, so
  switching a pentode to triode mode no longer changes the tube.
- Ratings: 12AU7 Va max 330 V; 6P45S Va max 400 V, Ik max 500 mA.

### Changed
- The engine and both SPICE exports use Koren's published equations exactly
  (the `(1 + sgn(E1))` factor was missing, and the pentode plate term was
  normalised by 2/π). Koren parameters are now interchangeable with other
  Koren-style SPICE models. Saved circuits will show different, correct,
  operating points.

### Added
- `tests/datasheets.mjs`: reference operating points with sources for all
  35 amplifier tubes; `scripts/fit-tubes.mjs` fits the models to them.
- Tests: every tube against its datasheet; triode/pentode mode consistency;
  EL84 and 6V6GT datasheet cathode-bias circuits simulated end to end.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-10-07

First release as a standalone project (previously developed inside
[aerocat.tech](https://aerocat.tech/tools/)).

### Added
- Schematic editor (`circuit_sandbox.html`): zoomable sheet, grid snapping,
  drag-to-move parts and wire segments, box select, undo/redo, autosave,
  JSON save/open and SPICE netlist export.
- Parts: resistor, potentiometer, capacitors, choke, SE and push-pull/UL output
  transformers, power transformer, B+ and bias supplies, signal generator,
  silicon diode, speaker, ground, oscilloscope probe, and 40 tubes
  (triodes, pentodes/beam tetrodes, rectifiers).
- Circuit simulator (`sim-engine.js`, in a Web Worker): modified nodal
  analysis with Newton-Raphson, Koren triode/pentode models with grid and
  screen current, vacuum-diode rectifiers, coupled transformer windings, and
  periodic steady state with extrapolation so supplies settle in milliseconds.
- Curve tracer (`index.html`) follows the tube selected in the editor: plate
  curves, simulated load line, operating point, gain and THD.
- Oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer pages fed live from the editor's probes.
- Design-rule checks: missing ground, unconnected pins, shorted windings.
- Engine accuracy tests against closed-form results, an independent Koren
  solve and an RK4 reference; browser end-to-end tests of every page.

### Known issues
- Several tube models deviate from datasheet operating points by more than
  20 % (fixed in 3.1.0).
