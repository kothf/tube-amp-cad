## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2026-10-07

First release as a standalone project (previously developed inside
[aerocat.tech](https://aerocat.tech/tools/)).

### Added
- Schematic editor (`circuit_sandbox.html`): zoomable sheet, grid snapping,
  drag-to-move parts and wire segments, box select, undo/redo, autosave,
  JSON save/open and SPICE netlist export.
- Parts: resistor, potentiometer, capacitors, choke, SE and push-pull/UL output
  transformers, power transformer, B+ and bias supplies, signal generator,
  silicon diode, speaker, ground, oscilloscope probe, and 40 tubes
  (triodes, pentodes/beam tetrodes, rectifiers).
- Circuit simulator (`sim-engine.js`, in a Web Worker): modified nodal
  analysis with Newton-Raphson, Koren triode/pentode models with grid and
  screen current, vacuum-diode rectifiers, coupled transformer windings, and
  periodic steady state with extrapolation so supplies settle in milliseconds.
- Curve tracer (`index.html`) follows the tube selected in the editor: plate
  curves, simulated load line, operating point, gain and THD.
- Oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer pages fed live from the editor's probes.
- Design-rule checks: missing ground, unconnected pins, shorted windings.
- Engine accuracy tests against closed-form results, an independent Koren
  solve and an RK4 reference; browser end-to-end tests of every page.

### Known issues
- Several tube models deviate from datasheet operating points by more than
  20 % (12AX7, 12AT7, 6SN7GT, 300B, 2A3, 6V6GT, 6L6GC, EL34). They are listed
  as `todo` tests in `tests/engine.test.mjs`; see README › Accuracy.
